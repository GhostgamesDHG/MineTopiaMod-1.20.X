# MinetopiaMod 1.20.X
These are the files of the new MineTopia Mod :)
If there is an issue report it to the issue page.

The Mod is currently in a very early stage. You can play this mod already in an older minecraft version. 

If you want to play the new version you need to download the source code and build the jar yourself. There will also be jar files here, but they are not updated very often.

**These thing need to be done**
