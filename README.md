This is still a work in progress, but we are getting there slowly

The releases are on Modrinth and Curseforge.

**Some ideas that I will work on**
<!-- TOC -->
* Fitness
* Loan
* ATM
* Computer
* Scoreboard (Can be toggled on and off)
* More furniture
* More clothes/armor than the previous version (Will be in a GUI I think)
* And more.....

**These thing need to be done**
<!-- TOC -->
* Add all the recipes PARTLY ACTIVE
* Add 3 blocks back from the previous version.
* Add the clothes back
* _The safe block needs a rewrite. You cannot set a password if you are playing on a server_
<!-- TOC -->
Some Items have been removed because they are useless.
